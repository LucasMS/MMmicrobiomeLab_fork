# MicrobiomeGenomics

We are a research group at the Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology (IKMB) in Kiel. Our research is centered on exploring the dynamics of bacterial genomes, bacterial functions, and host-microbe interactions in the context of health versus disease and throughout human evolution.

Our primary objective is to gain a functional understanding of host-microbe systems. We specifically concentrate on assembling and characterizing an extensive collection of human gut microbiomes and bacterial strains in pure culture from diverse global populations. To achieve this, we employ in silico, in vitro, and in vivo approaches to identify actionable features within host-associated microbiomes that can contribute to enhancing human health.
